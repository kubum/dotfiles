Configuration files for tmux (currently), largely based on [maximum-awesome](https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome) 

## What's in it?

* [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/)
* [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
* Awesome syntax highlighting with the [Solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)

### tmux

* `<C-a>` is the prefix
* mouse scroll initiates tmux scroll
* `prefix v` makes a vertical split
* `prefix s` makes a horizontal split

If you have three or more panes:
* `prefix +` opens up the main-horizontal-layout
* `prefix =` opens up the main-vertical-layout

You can adjust the size of the smaller panes in `tmux.conf` by lowering or increasing the `other-pane-height` and `other-pane-width` options.
